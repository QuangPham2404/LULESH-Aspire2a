# Aspire2A Operating Rules

## Authentication

- Never request, read, store, transmit, echo, or log any SSH password.
- Never use `sshpass`, Expect, password files, clipboard extraction,
  environment variables, or command-line password arguments.
- Never attempt to modify SSH authentication settings.
- Never automate password entry.
- Never install tools merely to bypass interactive authentication.

## Persistent SSH connection

- Before remote work, check the connection with:

  `ssh -O check aspire2a`

- If the connection is unavailable, stop and ask the user to run:

  `aspire-connect`

- Do not initiate a normal interactive SSH login.

## Required SSH mode

- For every Codex-controlled SSH command, use:

  `ssh -o BatchMode=yes aspire2a '<command>'`

- For every Codex-controlled SCP command, use:

  `scp -o BatchMode=yes ...`

- For every Codex-controlled rsync command, use:

  `rsync -e 'ssh -o BatchMode=yes' ...`

## Remote scope

- Remote project root:

  `/home/users/ntu/pham0094/scratch/LULESH-Aspire2a`

- Do not read, write, modify, or delete files outside the project root
  without explicit approval.
- Do not use `sudo`.
- Do not install Codex, package managers, background services, daemons,
  proxies, or remote agents on Aspire2A.
- Do not modify shared software. Most of the required package for buildings should be found from the available modules. If the agent need to install a new software package that is not available, you need to ask for the user permission first.
- During the execution process, you are only to create folders and create/edit files. Do NOT delete folders without asking for user permission.

## Scheduler policy

- Run computation through batch jobs via PBS.
- Do not perform computational workloads on login nodes.
- Do not poll PBS excessively.

## Result integrity

Each run should record:

- experiment ID;
- PBS job ID;
- timestamp;
- hostname or node allocation;
- compiler and compiler version;
- MPI implementation and version;
- loaded modules;
- build flags;
- input parameters;
- requested resources;
- runtime;
- correctness or convergence result;
- stdout path;
- stderr path;
- exit status.

Do not classify a job as successful based only on exit code.
Validate expected output and correctness criteria.

## Git policy

- Aspire2A should use a real Git clone of this repository at the remote project root.
- Commit rules: only commit the scripts/results/etc when the build/run is SUCCESFULL. For unsuccessful cases, record the errors, your corresponding implemented solution clearly as you try to patch the errors yourself. The agent have permission to self patch build/run errors yourself unless specified otherwise.
- Manage the local PC clone and Aspire2A clone with this procedure:
  - Before starting work in either environment, run `git status` and `git pull --ff-only`.
  - Before committing, run `git status` and inspect the relevant diff.
  - Commit only reviewed/useful scripts, plans, progress notes, extracted results, metadata, and logs.
  - Prefer committing and pushing from the local PC.
  - After pushing from one environment, pull with `git pull --ff-only` in the other environment before continuing work there.
  - If `git pull --ff-only` fails because the clones diverged, stop and inspect instead of creating a merge commit.
- Local-to-Aspire2A script workflow:
  - When Codex creates or updates build scripts, PBS scripts, run scripts, extraction scripts, or planning files locally for remote execution, Codex must commit and push those local changes first, after user approval if required.
  - Before using those scripts on Aspire2A, Codex must SSH into Aspire2A, go to the remote project root, and run `git pull --ff-only`.
  - Do not run stale local-only scripts on Aspire2A. The remote clone should receive local script changes through Git before build/run work starts.
  - This rule covers the local PC to Aspire2A direction. Aspire2A to local result handling may use a separate workflow decided later.
- Prefer local Git operations.
- Do not store GitHub credentials on Aspire2A.
- Do not push without explicit user approval.
- Do not commit raw temporary files unless requested.
